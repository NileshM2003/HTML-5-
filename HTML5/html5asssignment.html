        <h3>1. What are the new tags added in HTML5?</h3>
            &#10146;
            HTML5 introduced several new elements and attributes that provide better semantics, structure, and functionality to web documents. Here are some of the key additions:
            
            Semantic Elements:<br><br>

                canvas>: Provides a drawing space for graphics on a webpage.<br>
                svg>: Defines vector-based graphics for the web.<br>
                These are some of the major additions brought by HTML5. They improve the semantics, accessibility, and functionality of web documents.<br><br>
                
                <h3>2.How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
                </h3>
        &#10146;Embedding Audio:
        <br>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="audio_file.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
          Your browser does not support the audio element. <br>
        </audio><br><br>
        The controls attribute adds audio controls like play, pause, and volume.<br>
        You can specify multiple <br> <source> <br><br> elements to provide different audio formats for better browser compatibility.<br>
        Embedding Video:<br><br>
        html
        <br>
        <video controls width="400" height="200">
          <source src="video_file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          Your browser does not support the video element.<br>
        </video><br>
        The controls attribute adds video controls like play, pause, and volume.<br>
        You can specify multiple source> elements to provide different video formats for better browser compatibility.<br>
        You can also set the width and height attributes to specify the dimensions of the video.<br>
        Make sure to replace "audio_file.mp3" and "video_file.mp4" with the actual paths to your audio and video files. Additionally, provide alternative text or a message between the opening and closing tags of audio> and video> elements for browsers that do not support them.<br>

       <b><li>3.Semantic element in HTML5?</li></b>
        &#10146; 
        Semantic elements in HTML5 are elements that carry meaning about the content they contain. They provide a clearer structure to the HTML document, making it more understandable for both humans and machines (such as search engines and screen readers). Here are some commonly used semantic elements in HTML5:<br><br>
        
        header>: Represents introductory content, typically containing headings, navigation links, or other elements related to the header of a document or section.<br>
        
        nav>: Represents a section of navigation links, allowing users to navigate the website or move between different parts of the document.<br>
        
        main>: Represents the main content of the document. It should not contain content that is repeated across multiple pages, such as site navigation or copyright information.<br>
        
        section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. It helps to organize content into distinct sections.<br>
        
        article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post, article, or comment. It can be distributed independently from the rest of the document.<br>
        
        aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.<br>
        
        footer>: Represents the footer of a document or section, typically containing metadata, copyright information, or contact details.<br><br>

        <h3>4.Canvas and SVG tags  </h3><br>
         canvas>:<br>

    The canvas> element provides a drawable region defined in HTML code with JavaScript.<br>
    It is used for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes, graphics, and animations.<br>
   The drawing is done programmatically via JavaScript using a set of drawing APIs.<br>
   The content of a canvas is not accessible to search engines or screen readers unless explicitly provided through alternate means.<br> 
        
   svg>:<br>

    The svg> element defines a graphics container that can contain shapes, paths, text, and other graphical elements.<br>
    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and it's based on XML syntax.<br>
    SVG content is part of the DOM (Document Object Model), so it can be easily styled and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.<br>
    SVG graphics are scalable and resolution-independent, making them ideal for creating vector graphics, icons, charts, and interactive graphics.<br>
    SVG content is accessible to search engines and screen readers.<br>
